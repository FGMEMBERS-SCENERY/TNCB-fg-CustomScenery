How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following folder:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w070n10 -> w069n12

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "1825165" otherwise it won't work later.










If there is any problem or request you can mail me in lukas hangar.
